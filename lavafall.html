                            <em><strong>My takeaway: </strong>The level had a variety of issues, many of which would have been trivial to identify and fix if I had adequately prioritized playtesting. With both the other projects on my portfolio, I learned to prioritize playtesting early and often, and avoided similar problems.</em>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Issue 1:</strong> Late in the level, I created a platforming challenge that was far too difficult. 
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>I wanted it to be more difficult than previous platforming, as the reward for completion was one of the strongest weapons in the game. But I underestimated the brutal timing required, and many players opted to skip it and forgo the weapon reward entirely.</li>
                                        <li>With playtesting, the difficulty would have been clear, and I could have made easy adjustments to make the challenge much more forgiving.</li>
                                    </ul> 
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Issue 2:</strong> Throughout the combat encounters in the level, I misunderstood enemy types and created encounters that were too hectic.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Encounters were difficult to parse, and players did not make use of the spaces in arenas because they were constantly overloaded with threats.</li>
                                        <li>With playtesting, I would have found that combat pacing was too fast and tuned down the amount of enemy types.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>

                                <li><strong>Issue 3:</strong> I created a recurring breakable rock for the level, but the active/inactive indicator was overlooked and players were left confused.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Players only paid attention to the unique color and texture of the rocks, so when they were inactive (shown by the absence of a smoke stream), players had no idea why the mechanic they learned previously was not working. </li>
                                        <li>With playtesting, it would have been obvious that the indicator was unclear to players, and I could have solved this by showing active/inactive through color and texture changes instead.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>

                                <li>Players who reviewed my level were disappointed with the ending, and I believe it is because of two main problems:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Problem 1: The gameplay does not evolve.</strong> The player has finally reached the destination they have been working towards, excited to discover what it holds - only for it to thrust them straight back into the same setting and content they've experienced through the rest of the level.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Problem 2: Unique elements have little impact on gameplay.</strong> The central piece of this final combat zone is the large floating crystal. It fires a beam throughout the arena as it does earlier in the level. But I tuned this beam poorly, and it has almost no impact on how the fight plays out.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>

                                <li>What I learned here played a big role in my decision making for <strong><a href="ancient-outskirts.html" target="_blank">The Ancient Outskirts</a></strong>. I cut a lot of content from the end of that level, in part because it was too much of the same content and it detracted from the level's most important moments.</li>
